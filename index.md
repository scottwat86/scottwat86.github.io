## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

# BIO
Hello world! My name is Scott and I grew up in California and Washington. I graduated in 2010 from University of Washington with a BS in Engineering. Although I had several experiences with technology in my youth, from building my first computer at age 10, to experimenting with Red Hat Linux command line, I never went pro. In my mid-career as a project manager I've decided to make the leap move into technology. This site is dedicated to my data science and programming journey. Lets learn some Python 3!

# Background
Red Hat Linux - 1 year (self taught)  
Unix/Linux System Admin - 3 month (CEU @ UW)  
Javascript - 3 month (self taught)  
Java - 3 month (TCC college course)  
MATLAB - 6 months (college course in FEM modeling of structual elements)

## Automating Excel with PIPIWIN32 and COM objects
Today I researched PYPIWIN32 and the good old COM Objects to automatocally update all the external data references in a list of an Excel files. This will save some time monthly at my current work. I found several examples as this is apparently a really old application. I ran into a hiccup trying to prevent the dialog boxes from showing up and holding up the automation. I was able to save the file without a dialog but still am having trouble ignoring the data load dialog. I will work on it a little more tomorrow.  

## Bayes's Theorem Review  
Prob of A given B = (Prob A * Prob B given A) / Prob B  
P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A) / P(B)

## Expressions vs Statments  
__Expresions__  
* Include values and functions that are combined and interpreted to form new values  
* Purpose is to create a value and have side effects  
* Small expr. can be combined / composed into large expr. (Composable -> self-contained & statelss)  
* Pure expr. / subexpr. do not have implied order of execution / dependencies  
* Leads to simpler code than statements   

__Statement__  
* Are standalone exceution and never return values    
* Purpose is to have side effects  
* Are not supported in a pure functional language  
* Have implied order of execution and depend on prior statements for evaluation  
* Are less adaptable as the dependencies prevent code portability  
* Require variables to be set up outside before use  
* E.g. assignmens, conditional branch, loops, classes, import, def, try, except, pass, del

## Decorators:  
Went down the rabbit hole on Python Decorators. Quite interesting but also complex. It will take me a while to be able to implemt these but got the idea of a function to modify another function with the best example. A Decorator to time the run time of any function. Cool beans!  

## Programming Developmet Attitudes  
Martin Fowler discusses DirectingAttitude vs EnablingAttitude in programming. The funny thing is this paradigm shows up in many subjects. Theoretical vs practical. Applied Math vs Math. Even True Colors Personalities -> Freedom-Seeking (Orange) Rule Breakers vs Structured-Seeking (Gold) Rule Enforcers. Either way these pesonality tendency exist because they both have value. Sometimes we need order and other times we just need to get stuff done whatever way its flowing. Torwards the end Martin Fowler points out that in large part it can simply come down to viewpoint. Is the glass half full or half empty... Its just a glass of water.

## Object Oriented Langauges (OOP)  
* __Encasulation__	- Group related variables/function			- Reduces complexity & increases reusablility/portability  

* __Abstraction__	- Simplifies interface by hidding the details		- Reduces complexity & isolates impact of changes  

* __Inheritances__	- Similar object can use the same functions/var.	- Eliminates redundant code  

* __Polymorpherism__	- Functions behaviour changes with the object/inputs	- Adds flexibility to functions

Completed EX1 - EX8 on Learning Python3 the hard way and then hit the paywall. Found a copy of the book for free but it doesn't seem to follow the same foremat as the website EX. The book is mainly text where the site is examples to transcribe. Not exactly the most problem solving focused methodology but I can see how process and good habits matter and practice makes perfect!

# SKIPPED 05-24-2019  ROAD TRIP

# 05-23-2019
Joined Triage though it may take a while to find a pull request that I can troubleshoot confidently. At the minimum this site will get me exposed to real world programming issues. Its how I found Namba and optimization problems for SciPy.

Down the rabbit hole ... background research on the packages to learn down the line:

__Arrays & Engineering Computation__
* NumPy 		-Arrays and linear algebra
* SciPy			-Various functions to operate on numpy arrays & scientific and engineering applications.

__Optimization__
* Namba			-Creates Just-in-time(JIT) machine code to speed up array/numerical calculatons similar to C/C++/FORTRAN

__Visualizations__
* Matplotlib		-general purpose & 
* pandas		-quick plots
* seaborn		-statistical plots
* bokeh			-interactive plots & web browsers for presentation

https://python-graph-gallery.com/  
https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/  


__Machine Learning__
* scikit-learn		-classification, regression, clustering algorithms incl. support vector machines, random forests, 
			 gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN

Brought me back to my MATLAB days. Their are some great resources out there.

10 Python tips and tricks:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-gEQdGVXbk&t=814s

# RW

__(1) Assigning value with ternary conditional__
``` markdown
condition = True

x = 1 if condition else 0
```


__(2) readability of large numbers__
```markdown
x = 100_000_000  #instead of x = 100000000
print(f'{total:,}')   # Formats input with ','
```


__(3) Context Manager (eg openning/closing files/databases -> managing resources)__
```markdown

#import os
#os.getcwd() #shows the working dir for opening the file

with open('test.txt', 'r') as f:
	file_contents = f.read()    #automatically closes file once completed the read

print(file_contents)
```


__(4) Enumerate() -> adds a counting var to iterable__
```markdown
names = ['Corey', 'Scott', 'Brian']

for index, name in enumerate(names, start=1):  # starts at index=1
	print(index, name) #returns index and value
```


__(5) Accesing index and value in two lists__
``` markdown
names = ['Peter Parker', 'Clark Kent', 'Wade Wilson', 'Bruce Wayne']
heroes = ['Spiderman', 'Superman', 'Deadpool', 'Batman']

for index, name in enumerate(names):
	hero = heroes[index]
	print(f'{name} is actually {hero}')   #pulls corresponding values with index from each list
```


__(6) Interrelated list unpacking ->  Zip()__
``` markdown
names = ['Peter Parker']   #stops on the shortest list
heroes = ['Spiderman']   
universes = ['Marvel']  

#zip creates a single tuple of 3 strings
for name, hero, universe in zip(names, heroes, universes):  
	print(f'{name} is actually {hero} from {universe}')
```
Output: "Peter Parker is actually Spiderman from Marvel"


__(7) Unpacking variable length and throw away data list/tuples__
```markdown
a, _, *c, d = [1,2,3,4,5,]

#'_' throws away 2

print(c) # c = 3,4 
```

__(8) Adding/retrieving attributes dynamically (value is variable)__
```markdown
class Person():
	# name = 'Jack'
	pass 	# As long as no arg in class use 'pass'

person = Person()
first_key = 'name'   # attribute name
first_val = 'Corey'  # attribute 

setattr(person, first_key, first_val) 
first = getattr(person, first_key, first_val)

print(first) 

#              key       value
person_info = {'height': 70,   'weight': 175}
for key, value in person_info.items():   #items() returns index, value of dict
	setattr(person,key,value)

print(person.height)  #returns height value in inch
print(person.weight)

delattr(person,'height') #deletes attr 'height'

dir(person) # to list the methods and attributes on a class
```


__(9) Sensitive info -> enter your password__
```markdown
from getpass import getpass

usr = input('Username:')
pw = getpass('Password:')  # password doesn't show up in terminal


__Module Docs__
help() # returns details about module / documentation

```

# Python Exercise 1 / 100

```markdown
#Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
#between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
#The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

s = []

for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if i%7 == 0 and i%5 != 0:

# Python Exercise 2 / 100

```markdown

#Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
#The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#!8 -> 40320

n = 0
factorial = 1
f = []

n = input("Enter a number to apply the factorial \n")
n = int(n)

if n == 0:
    f = ['1']
else:    
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        factorial = factorial*i
        f.append(str(factorial))
    
    
print(",".join(f)) 
```

I chose to not use the factorial function and only briefly looked at the code when I found it. The tutorial I'm following must be using Python 2 as their solution code won't run on Jupitor and I gave up debugging. It returns the factorial but not a single line comma delimited sequence per the instructions.
